I am a full-stack software engineer with a passion for building apps and solutions to enrich people's lives.
I work with: HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Bootstrap4, JavaScript, EJS, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Mongoose, Flask, Python, Git/Github
I believe that technology and software engineering is a collaborative experience that connects people. Nobody builds apps only for themselves, so naturally there is a desire and a need to help and create solutions to better the world, and as a result, it's extremely rewarding to be a developer in tech.
